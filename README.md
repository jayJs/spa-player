SPA player
===================

A way to play Single Page Apps without server and auto refresh on save.  
Sort of like MAMP for SPA-s.  

##Problem  
It's challenging to set up Single Page Apps for local development, if you can't run the server at the same time. The situation occurred for me, if I tried to convince a front-end to (first install and then) run a NodeJS server.  

##Solution
This here  
1. starts a simple HTTP server at your selected port which...  
2. ...serves a HTML file of your preference.  
3. Bonus - if you include a code snippet to your site, this helps to automatically refresh the site in browser every time there's a change in code.
