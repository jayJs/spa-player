SPA player
===================

A way to play Single Page Apps without server and auto refresh on save.  
Sort of like MAMP for SPA-s.  

##Problem  
It's hard to set up Single Page Apps for local development without running the server at the same time. And sometimes it's difficult to convince your designer / front-end to run the server.  

##Solution
This application here does what MAMP/WAMP does for PHP development.  
1. Starts a simple HTTP server at your selected port which...  
2. ...serves a HTML file of your preference.  
3. Bonus - if you include a code snippet to your site, this helps to automatically refresh the site in browser every time there's a change in code.
